<h1>Drumming</h1>
<h3>Playing the set</h3>
<p>My first drumset had paper heads and I got it when I was around 4 years old. I loved it. I figured out how to play with songs on my own. I ended up getting my first real drumset when I was in 6th grade.</p>
<h3>My first show</h3>
<p>My first show playing the drums was in 6th grade. I played in front of the high school. There was a sound issue so I played a drum solo. I was nervous, but just wanted to play.</p>
<p>We will make a break here.<br>  A break can be used anywhere.  It is a line break.</p>
